Accelerator is a 2D space shooting game written in Java using LibGDX and Slick2D. This is a classic arcade style game inspired by Galaga. It was originally started as a music based game titled "Accelerando", but the idea was changed over time. The main objective is to gain a high score by destroying enemy ships -- there are no levels or bosses, the player must survive as the enemy ships attack faster over time. 
The player loses once their health reaches 0.

<b>Controls</b> <br>
(A) -- Shoot missile <br>
(Left/Right/Up/Down) -- Move the player's spaceship <br>
(P) -- Pause the game <br>
(R) [While paused] -- Resume the game <br>
(Q) [While paused] -- Quit the game and return to the main menu <br>

From the main menu, press (1) to play the game and (2) to change the game settings. <br>
To change difficulty settings, enter the options menu and select easy (E), medium (M), or hard (H). <br>
Higher difficulties lead to stronger and faster enemies whose speed increases over time.<br>

TODO: Implement quad-tree for more efficient collision detection.
